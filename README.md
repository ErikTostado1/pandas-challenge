•  Summarizes the analysis 
	-Seven out of 8 of the 9 large schools have a lower overall passing percentage than the other smaller schools.
It seems that class size makes a big difference in over all performance. 
	-Reading scores are typically higher than math scores. Across all school types, school sizes, budgets this pattern prominent. 
Schools with a greater difference between the two seem to have a lower overall passing rate; 
while schools with minor differences have a higher passing rate. 
	-The bottom 5 schools are all district schools and the top 5 are charter. 
Charter schools on average have a higher math & reading score in comparison to district schools.  

•  Draw two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations
	-Higher spending does not guarantee greater performance. 
The top performing schools have shared student budget ranges of those that are low performing.
The top two performing schools are in the lower threshold of budget ranges. 
	-There seems to be very little variance in comparison for reading and math averages across all grades.
Overall average performance seems to stay adhesive in a small numerical range.
This number pattern is prevalent in all schools in all grades.
